# ImageNow iScripts Tutorials

### Overview

iScripts is the language that is used by ImageNow to script actions such as workflow, eForms, Tasks, and INTool

Throughout this tutorial I will be using Submime Text 2 as the editor. I have created a language library for Sublime Text that understands some of the ImageNow specific objects. The GitHub repository for iScripts can be found [here](http://github.com/miu2n/iscript-sublime/).

I will also be using the STL Library that ImageNow should send with ImageNow and it should be located in the scripts directory of your ImageNow installation in a folder called STL.

### Assumptions

Because this tutorial is about iScripts and iScripts are based on JavaScript I will assume that you already know how to use JavaScript (at least the basics). If you do not yet know how JavaScript works then I would suggest going through either the [W3Schools tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) or the [Lynda.com tutorial](http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-training-tutorials/244-0.html) on JavaScript.

### Next Steps
